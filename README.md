# Operating Systems – Course Summary
This repository contains my complete lab work and assignments for the Operating Systems course. It covers all major topics from Linux basics to advanced process synchronization and memory management.

## Core Topics and Lab Work
### Linux Commands & Shell Scripting

- Navigated and manipulated files using ls, cat, grep, sed, etc.

- Wrote shell scripts for automation and user interaction tasks.

### Process Management & System Calls

- Used fork(), execve(), and wait() to create and manage processes.

- Demonstrated zombie and orphan process states through test programs.

### Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

- Implemented Pipes/FIFOs for parent-child and client-server communication.

- Used Shared Memory segments to share data between processes.

### CPU Scheduling Algorithms

- Simulated and analyzed: FCFS, SJF (preemptive/non-preemptive), Round Robin.

### Disk Scheduling Algorithms

- Implemented FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C‑SCAN, LOOK, and C‑LOOK algorithms.

### Memory Management & Page Replacement

- Developed FIFO, LRU, Optimal, and LFU page-replacement strategies.

###Deadlock & Concurrency Control

- Solved classic synchronization problems: Producer‑Consumer, Reader‑Writer.

- Implemented Banker's Algorithm for deadlock avoidance.

## Skills & Insights Gained
- Thorough experience with Linux environment and shell scripting

- Strong understanding of process lifecycle and system call interaction

- Mastered IPC mechanisms — pipes, FIFOs, shared memory

- Deep knowledge of scheduling theory and performance comparisons

- Practical implementations of memory/page management and replacement strategies

- Learned thread synchronization and deadlock prevention using semaphores, mutexes, and Banker’s algorithm

- Improved on debugging, testing, and code modularization in C
